        <p> <h4>Own a multi-location business? Here’s how to grow traffic and get more customers.</h4>
            In 2023, 8.5 billion Google searches are made every single day. Google My Business (GMB) helps you tap into that traffic by aggregating all of your brand’s important information in one place. It’s essentially an online directory that allows you to market your business to customers who are actively on the hunt for a product or service like yours. For this reason, it’s important to not only set up a Google My Business profile, but keep it up to date.

            <p><h4>What is a GMB business group?</h4>
            A business group is a collection of GMB profiles managed by the one organisation. Having a business group makes it easier to manage multiple business locations, ensuring consistency of branding across all a business’ profiles and making user access that much simpler.
            
            Here’s how to manage a Google My Business profile for multiple locations.</p>

<p><h4> Create a location group</h4>
    It’s in Google’s best interests to keep the platform simple, which is why you can (and should) control multiple business locations from a business group account — also known as a location group. This account should be registered with your main company email address. Better yet, use a shared business account like admin@twocooks.com.au, and share the login details with the most senior members of staff. </p>

<p><h4>Choose your owners and managers wisely</h4>
    Employees come and go, so it’s important you put your GMB profile’s security in the right hands. When it comes to your profile, there are two types of users: owners and managers. As the owner, you can make changes to key information for the location group or business profile, such as address, phone number, business name and URL. Managers are added by you and cannot update or change this information.
    
    While managers have restricted access, they still have the ability to reply to reviews and publish posts — so it’s important that those you choose to give access to are trusted members of the business. You should also have a procedure in place should that person ever depart the business. </p>
